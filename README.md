  yeah that pretty much describes this.

# Overview
Catbot is a Modular Discord bot.
<br><br>

# Running
There is no official release yet because CatBot is still in development. 
<br>
So for now just clone the repository with
```
gh repo clone Catsally/CatBot
cd catbot/CatBot
```
Then if you don't already have it you'll have to import discord.py in the python terminal with
### Windows
```
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```
### Mac
```
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```
Then in token.txt in ./cogs/data enter a discord bot token which you can generate by creating a discord app.
<br>
Then you're all set! Just run bot.py and there you have a CatBot!
